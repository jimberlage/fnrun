# fnrun

`fnrun` is a library that provides utilities for building and executing
function runners with isolation.

This library provides an implementation that can be used to interface with CLI
applications using the [fnrun-proto](https://github.com/tessellator/fnrun-proto)
protocol buffers to stream data over stdin and stdout to the CLI application.
